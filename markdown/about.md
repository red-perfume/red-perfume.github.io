## Why is it called "Red Perfume"

This library takes in any CSS and breaks it down to pure Atomic CSS. This is a process called "CSS Atomization", and libraries that do this process are called "CSS Atomizers".

Outside of our industry jargon, "Atomizer" already exists as a word.

> **Atomizer** <sub><sup>(*NOUN*)</sup></sub>
> 1. A device for emitting water, perfume, or other liquids as a fine spray.
>
> \- [Oxford English Dictionary](https://www.lexico.com/definition/atomizer)

Though actual atomizers themselves have no consistent size, design, color, or shape. So there is no iconic image that represents them.

And though perfume bottles can also come in many shapes, colors, sizes and designs, they are still recognizable as perfume bottles.
