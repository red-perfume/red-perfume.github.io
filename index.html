    <h1>Red Perfume</h1>
    <p>
      "Red Perfume" is a group of open source projects, primarily focused on Atomizing CSS:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Red-Perfume-Task-Runner</strong></a>
        A simplified and focused task runner for websites/webapps.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Red-Perfume-CSS</strong>
        A library that takes in any arbitrary CSS and returns an atomized version, including a JSON "classMap" for HTML atomization and dynamic JavaScript.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Red-Perfume-HTML</strong>
        A library that takes in any arbitrary HTML and the JSON "classMap" from Red-Perfume-CSS and atomizes the markup.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Red-Perfume-Desktop</strong>
        Eventually we plan on creating a desktop app version of Red Perfume as well, written with Vue.js and NW.js.
